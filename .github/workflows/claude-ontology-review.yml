            This PR modifies critical ontology files.

            Review this PR against our team checklist:

            ## Issue alignment
            - [ ] The PR aligns with the source issue, and only closes it if all components of the issue addressed
            - [ ] The PR summary gives sufficient context for any decisions made, attributing them to issue authors where appropriate

            ## Ontology Metadata
            - [ ] PR is linked to source issue(s) via appropriate annotation property
            - [ ] any added definitions have provenance

            ## Identifiers and hallucinations
            - [ ] all identifiers are CURIEs (or URLs), with standard prefixes
            - [ ] I have looked up term identifiers and confirm that they denote what is intended
            - [ ] all PMIDs and publication references resolve to the appropriate article/title

            ## Design patterns (DPs)
            - [ ] any new terms conform to documented DPs for this ontology
            - [ ] if the term fits into a DP, then the label is constructed in a standard way (although scientific norms prevail)
            - [ ] if the term is compositional in nature, then it should conform to a DP, and have a relevant logical definition

            ## Definitions (if the PR adds or updates a definition)
            - [ ] Definitions are present for any new term
            - [ ] Definitions conform to the style guide for this ontology
            - [ ] Definitions follows genus-differentia form (while prioritizing normal scientific phrasing over awkward ontology language)
            - [ ] The genus of the definition is an ancestor of the term
            - [ ] The differentia of the definition are necessary and sufficient for distinguishing from the genus
            - [ ] The definition has appropriate provenance
            - [ ] I have looked up the provenance, and it is correct and relevant
            - [ ] The label, definition, and logical definition (when present) are largely consistent

            ## Relationships and logical axioms
            - [ ] If a logical definition is not present, then there should be at least one is_a (subClassOf) to the most precise parent term
            - [ ] If a logical definition is present, then there is reasonable expectation the term should classify precisely
            - [ ] Other relationships are present to a reasonable degree and as dictated by the general ontology stye (e.g part-ofs for anatomy)
            - [ ] Additional logical axioms (such as disjointness) are added as appropriate, depending on ontology style, and design patterns
            - [ ] Additional logical axioms make sense and do not over-constrain

            Be constructive and helpful in your feedback.
